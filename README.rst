Saboteurs is a Python library to detect bad elements (or *weakest links*) from success/failure data.

We use it at the `Edinburgh Genome Foundry <http://genomefoundry.org/>`_ to identify defectuous genetic parts early. Sometimes when assembling large fragments of DNA, each with typically 5 to 25 parts, we observe that some assemblies have far fewer successes ("good clones") than some others. We use Saboteurs to identify possible parts which would be causing the damage. This would generally mean that the sample corresponding to these parts has been compromised.

Logical methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Identifying bad elements from experimental results**

Assume that a secret organization has a few dozen agents (**A**nna, **B**ob, **C**harlie, **D**olly, etc.). Regularly, the organization puts together a team (e.g. A, C, D) and sends them to a mission, which should succeed unless one of the members is a double-agent who will secretly sabotage the mission. Looking at the table below, can you identify the *saboteur(s)*?

======= ======= =======
Mission Members Outcome
======= ======= =======
1       A C D   Success
2       B C E   Failure
3       A B D   Success
4       D F G   Failure
======= ======= =======

Mission 2 raises suspicion on B, C, and E, but Mission 1 clears C, and mission 3 clears B. Therefore **C is a saboteur**. Meanwhile mission 4 raises **suspicion on F and G**, but while none of them is cleared by another mission, it is impossible to say if only F or only G or both are saboteurs.

The Saboteurs libary has a method ``find_logical_saboteurs`` which allows to do this reasoning many groups with many elements. Here is how you would solve the problem above:

.. code:: python

    from saboteurs import find_logical_saboteurs
    groups = {
        1: ['A', 'C', 'D'],
        2: ['B', 'C', 'E'],
        3: ['A', 'B', 'D'],
        4: ['D', 'F', 'G']
    }
    find_logical_saboteurs(groups, failed_groups=[2, 4])
    # result: {'saboteurs': ['E'], 'suspicious': ['G', 'F']}

In the result, ``suspicious`` is the list of all elements which only appear in
failing groups, and ``saboteurs`` is the list of suspicious elements which are
also the only suspicious element in at least one group (and therefore confirmed
unambiguously as saboteurs).

This feature is used to detect

**Designing experiment batches to find bad elements.**

We now assume that among all the possible groups you can form to make teams, you want
to select a restricted batch of "test groups" so that, when you get the result
of all the groups in the batch, you will be able to identify any saboteur,
assuming thare there are at most 2. This is solved as follows with Saboteurs:

.. code:: python

    from saboteurs import find_logical_saboteurs
    all_possible_groups = {
        'group_1': ['A', 'B', 'C],
        'group_2': ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E'],
        ... and many more
    }
    selected_groups = design_test_batch(all_possible_groups, max_saboteurs=2)
    # result:
    # OrderedDict([('group_3', ('A', 'B', 'L')),
                   ('group_9', ('A', 'E', 'I', 'L')),
                   ... and more])
        

In practice, a group can have different "positions" and a given element can
only fill one of these positions. Consider for instance that there are 4
possible positions, with respective possible elements lists as follows: 

.. code:: python

    elements_per_position = {
        "Position_1": ['A', 'B', 'C'],
        "Position_2": ['D', 'E', 'F', 'G'],
        "Position_3": ['H', 'I', 'J', 'K'],
        "Position_4": ['L', 'M', 'N'],
    }

In that case there are 3x4x4x3=144 possible combinations, which can be generated
using saboteur's utility method ``generate_combinatorial_groups``:

.. code:: python

    from saboteurs import (generate_combinatorial_groups, design_test_batch)
    possible_groups = generate_combinatorial_groups(elements_per_position)
    selected_groups = design_test_batch(possible_groups, max_bad_elements=2)
    # result:
    # OrderedDict([('group_009', ('A', 'D', 'J', 'N')),
                   ('group_016', ('A', 'E', 'I', 'L')),
                   ... and 13 other groups])

Statistical methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Example 1:** assume that a secret organization has a few dozen agents (Anna, Bob, Charlie, etc.). Regularly, the organization puts together a group (Anna and David and Peggy) and sends that group to missions, some of which will be successful, some of which will fail. After a large number of missions, looking at the results of each group, you may ask: are there some agents which tend to lower the chances of success of the groups they are part of ?

With the Saboteurs library, you would first put your data in a spreadsheet ``data.csv`` like `this one <https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/saboteurs/blob/master/examples/basic_example/basic_example.csv>`_ then run the following script:

.. code:: python

  from saboteurs import (csv_to_groups_data,
                         find_statistical_saboteurs,
                         analysis_report)
  groups_data = csv_to_groups_data("data.csv")
  analysis_results = find_statistical_saboteurs(groups_data)
  analysis_report(analysis_results, "report.pdf")

You obtain the following `PDF report <https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/saboteurs/raw/master/examples/basic_example/basic_example.pdf>`_ highlighting which members have a significant negative impact on their groups, and where they appear:

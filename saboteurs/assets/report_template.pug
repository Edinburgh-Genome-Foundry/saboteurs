p These members have been selected because they tend to appear in groups that fail more, and be absent of groups that succeed.

p The p-value (from an ANOVA test) indicates how statistically significant this pattern is for each selected member. Smaller p-values mean greater significance.

p The "Effect" indicates how impactful the member is, i.e. how much the member belonging to a group increases this group's chances of failure, in average.

p The F1 score (between 0 and 1, 1 being best) score indicates how accurately one could predict the success or failure of a group, simply knowing which of these members are in the group. A low score (below 0.5) indicates that this report hasn't found any significant effect of a group's members on its success rate. 


h2 Were these members appear

p The next table shows the different groups, from the less to the most successful in average, and which failure-associated members each group contains.

p The "Mystery" column, when featuring two stars or more, indicates groups with a success rate that is not well explained by the presence of these members. This means either that the group was particularly successful while containing failure-associated members, or on the contrary that the group was unsuccessful despite containing no such member. In both cases, this indicates that the group's success was mainly driven by external factors.

Saboteurs
==========

Saboteurs is a Python library to detect bad elements (or *weakest links*)
from success/failure data. It is used at the Edinburgh Genome Foundry to
identify compromised samples of genetic parts, based on success statistics
from genetic assemblies involving these parts.

Saboteurs can also be used to design "test batches" which will allow to easily
identify bad elements.
